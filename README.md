# gmail-getter

## About package
A simple Node.js client that gets messages from Gmail API via http requests & OAuth. 

Contributions are very welcome!

## Installation
> npm install gmail-getter

## Requirements
To log into Gmail API you need to obtain credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, Refresh token.
These credentails will let you get an Access token, which is required in further requests (like getting list of emails or a single email and etc.).

Steps to go:
1. Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create **OAuth credentials** in [API & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) section (_preferably, select **Desktop** app there if you need it for automated tests_) and then download it.
3. Enable [Gmail API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/gmail.googleapis.com).
4. Obtain a Refresh token.

To get a Refresh token - simply execute a command in a project root:
> npx gmail-getter get-refresh-token

(or anywhere else if you've got the package installed globally)
> get-refresh-token

You must put `credentials.json` file (p.2) in a place where you execute the command.

> [!WARNING]  
> Credentials file name is name-sensitive - rename it to `credentials.json` if it's named different.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Refresh token expires after some time, especially if you don't use it for a while. Keep that in mind, since you'd need to generate a new one from time to time.

## Usage
### Import
Import whatever you need from the package:

```ts
// ES6+
import {getAccessToken, checkInbox} from 'gmail-getter'

// CommonJS
const {getAccessToken, checkInbox} = require('gmail-getter')
```

or the whole package:

```ts
// ES6+
import gmail from 'gmail-getter'

// CommonJS
const gmail = require('gmail-getter')
```

### Get Access token
You need to get an Access token before you execute other requests:

```ts
import {getAccessToken} from 'gmail-getter'

const accessToken = await getAccessToken(
  'your-client-id',
  'your-client-secret', 
  'your-refresh-token'
)
```

It'd probably be a good idea to get it on the earlier stages of a test run (global setup?) and store it as an environment variable.

### Check inbox
Use a polling function that returns [an email](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/get#response-body):

```ts
const email = await checkInbox({
  token: 'your-access-token', 
  query: 'from:your-email-username subject:Your-Email-Subject'
})
```

Options available:

* `token` is an access token
* `timeout` (optional) sets maximum execution time for the function
* `step` (optional) sets timeout between retries to fetch an email
* `all` (optional) says whether to find a single email or all mathing the query criteria
* `query` (optional) lets you filter out emails you want to find, you can find more about queries [there](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190)
* `logs` (optional) turns on or off polling logs of attempts to get emails

### Parse HTML from email
If your email contains html content - you can parse it and even render it in the browser with a browser automation tool (like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-set-content)):

```ts
const html = parseHtmlFromEmail(email)
```

* `email` is an email that you fetch with `checkInbox` function

If you're maintaining an automated test - this might be the best option, as you can verify contents of the email and click any links inside of it.

### Complete flow example
And that's how you can get an email you need. It'd probably be good to wrap the logic into a method and then call it from wherever you need (tests?).

```ts
import {getAccessToken, checkInbox} from 'gmail-getter'

const accessToken = await getAccessToken(
  'your-client-id', 
  'your-client-secret', 
  'your-refresh-token'
)

const email = await checkInbox({
  token: accessToken,
  query: 'your-query'
})
```
